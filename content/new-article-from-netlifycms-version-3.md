Netlify CMS has different options on how to handle authentication. We are going to use this config file to tell Netlify CMS that we want to use the GitHub for this. For repositories stored on GitHub, the github back end allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitHub account. Note that all users must have push access to their content repository for this to work.
